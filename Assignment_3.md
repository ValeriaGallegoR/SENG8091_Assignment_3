# EPIC_1 : Separate questions and answers

**As** AI developer
**I want** separate training questions from answers 
**To** facilitate the ability to evaluate and validate knowledge thus identifying areas for improvement

### Assumptions

Assume that the training model does not currently have a separate question and answer structure.

### Validations

- Describe how the training model is currently managed
- Are the questions separated from the answers?
- How do you differentiate questions from answers? Explain how you identify and what format you use.
- What are the criteria for separating questions from answers?
- How to identify that the answers correspond to the questions?
- Have you previously tried to implement this mechanism? If so, how did you do it and what was the result?
